# Age-and-Gender-classification-Using-EEG
Hey there! <br>
This is the code for gender classification using a 14 channel EEG device as used in the paper : "Kaushik, Pallavi et al. (2018). “EEG-based age and gender prediction using deep BLSTM-LSTM network
model”. In: IEEE Sensors Journal 19.7, pp. 2634–2641."
The code for age classification is similar to this apart from slight change as mentioned in the above paper.
<br>Happy coding!
